{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm experiencing intermittent, but consistent, data corruption when exporting large datasets (over 10GB) through the API. The error logs don't show any obvious issues, but checksum verification on the exported files consistently fails. I'm using the latest API version and have increased the timeout to 600 seconds as suggested in the documentation, but the problem persists. I suspect it might be related to the network buffer size during the transfer, but I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this further on your end."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I understand your concern about the data corruption and the inconsistent results you're seeing with your large API exports. That's definitely not the experience we want you to have, and I appreciate you providing such detailed information, especially the checksum failures and the timeout adjustment.  It sounds like you’ve already done some excellent initial troubleshooting.  Let's investigate this further. To help me pinpoint the root cause, could you please provide the specific API endpoint you’re using, the format of the exported data (CSV, JSON, etc.), and the approximate network bandwidth available during these exports?  I want to ensure we're looking at all possible factors contributing to this and will escalate this to our engineering team with all the details you can provide. We're committed to resolving this for you."}], "metadata": {"domain": "Customer Support", "subdomain": "Technical Support", "complexity_level": "medium", "communication_style": "deescalation", "emotional_tone": "concerned", "exchanges": 1}}
