Flower   D. Fruit\n\n2) The stem’s main job is to:\n   A. Make seeds\n   B. Hold the plant up and move water/food\n   C. Soak up sunlight only\n   D. Take in water from the soil\n\n3) Leaves mostly help plants to:\n   A. Breathe and make food using sunlight\n   B. Store seeds\n   C. Anchor the plant to the ground\n   D. Attract insects with smells\n\n4) Flowers usually help plants to:\n   A. Drink water\n   B. Make food\n   C. Make seeds\n   D.
