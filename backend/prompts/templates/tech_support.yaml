      Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble logging into my account. It says my password is incorrect but I'm sure it's right.
      Agent: Hello! I'd be happy to help you with that. Can you tell me if you've recently changed your password or if this is the first time you're experiencing this issue?
      Customer: I haven't changed it recently. It was working fine yesterday.
      Agent: I understand. Let's try resetting your password. I'm sending you a password reset link to your registered email. Please check your inbox and spam folder. Once you receive it, click the link and create a new password. This should resolve the issue.
      Customer: Got it, I'll do that. Thanks for your help!
      Agent: You're welcome! If you have any other issues after resetting your password, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!
